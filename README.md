# Rektosaurus

A test suite to check for client-side script injection on websites that display NFTs.

## Overview

NFTs contain a variety of metadata and content that gets processed and rendered all over the place. Some subspecies of NFTs (e.g. generative art) explicitly require arbitrary scripts to be executed. Allowing user-supplied code while preventing malicious actions is challenging. Rektosaurus implements a number of attacks to help test for client-side attacks.

[Payloads](payloads) are hosted on [rex.rektosaurus.io](https://rex.rektosaurus.io/).
